# Final Greenfoot Project

This game "Egg Collector" has players using a Chicken to collect Eggs, which randomly scatter on the road. The score is increased for each Egg collected.
Players will use keys to move the Chicken around, and must dodge the Cars, which also spawn randomly and move. The game ends when a Car hits the Chicken.
Cars will travel according to regular traffic, in the same direction for each road on the screen. Follow the pattern so your chances of being hit are lower!
The Chicken and Car's speeds will increase respectivelly as the score grows larger, as well as the spawning frequency of the Cars.

Note: The Chicken itself is quite small on the screen. If you adjust your location right, you can travel between car lanes without being hit by either lane!
